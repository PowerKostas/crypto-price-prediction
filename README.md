# crypto-price-prediction
The program takes cryptocurrency ticker names as input and uses historical data to predict the crypto's highest/closing price tomorrow. The program can also get the top 100 cryptos, based by market cap, and find the biggest "opportunities". There is a Coins folder that for each crypto that has already been searched there is a saved model, so it doesn't do the machine learning process again. There is also a Data_Analysed.csv file that saves the data of the last search of every crypto, the model continues from that point on. Made in April 2023.
